## If You Still Want Homebrew (Optional)

Homebrew is not needed for your website, but if you want it for other tools:

1. **Open Terminal** (Applications → Utilities → Terminal)

2. **Run this command**:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts**:
   - It will ask for your password (your Mac login password)
   - Press Enter to continue
   - It may ask you to press Return a few times

4. **After installation**, you can install other tools:
   ```bash
   brew install node  # If you want Node.js for local development
   ```

## What I Recommend

**Just use GitHub Desktop** - it's simpler and you don't need Homebrew!

Your website is already ready and committed. Just push it using GitHub Desktop (2 minutes vs 10+ minutes to install Homebrew).
