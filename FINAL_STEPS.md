# ✅ FINAL STEP - Enable GitHub Pages

## 🎉 Your website is ready!

The site has been deployed with the correct base path for GitHub Pages subfolder deployment.

## Critical Final Step:

### 1. Go to GitHub Pages Settings:
https://github.com/starryds/Denglab.github.io/settings/pages

### 2. Configure these settings:

**Source**: Select **"Deploy from a branch"**
- **Branch**: Select **"gh-pages"**
- **Folder**: Select **"/ (root)"**
- Click **"Save"**

### 3. Wait 2-3 minutes

### 4. Visit your website:
**https://starryds.github.io/Denglab.github.io/**

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Base path configured**: Website now uses `/Denglab.github.io/` base path
✅ **Assets will load correctly**: Images, CSS, and JS files have correct paths
✅ **Deployed to gh-pages branch**: Latest build is live

## Why It Was Blank Before

GitHub Pages was serving the old site configuration. Now:
- ✅ Correct base path set in `vite.config.js`
- ✅ Rebuilt with proper asset paths
- ✅ Redeployed to gh-pages branch
- ⏳ Just need to enable Pages in settings

**After you enable Pages in the link above, wait 2-3 minutes and your site will be live!**

## Update Your Website

To make changes:

1. Edit files in `src/components/`
2. Run: `npm run deploy`
3. Changes will go live in 2-3 minutes!
