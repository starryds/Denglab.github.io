# Authentication Required to Push to GitHub

Your website files are ready and committed locally, but you need to authenticate with GitHub to push them.

## What's Been Done ✅

- ✅ Website files created and committed
- ✅ GitHub remote added (https://github.com/starryds/Denglab.github.io.git)
- ✅ Ready to push

## Authentication Options

### Option 1: SSH Authentication (Recommended)

Set up SSH keys with GitHub:

1. **Check if you have SSH keys**:
   ```bash
   ls -al ~/.ssh
   ```

2. **Generate SSH key** (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   # Press Enter to accept default location
   # Press Enter twice for no passphrase (or set one for security)
   ```

3. **Add SSH key to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   # Copy your public key
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   # Copy the output
   ```
   
   Then:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/keys
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Paste your key and save

4. **Change remote to SSH**:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:starryds/Denglab.github.io.git
   ```

5. **Push again**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: GitHub CLI (Easiest)

Install and authenticate with GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Then push
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: Personal Access Token

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name and expiration
4. Select scopes: `repo` (all of it)
5. Click "Generate token" and copy it

Then use it when pushing:
```bash
# When prompted for username: starryds
# When prompted for password: paste the token
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 4: Manual Push via GitHub Desktop

1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Open the repository in GitHub Desktop
3. Click "Push origin" button

## After Successful Push

Once your files are pushed:

1. Go to https://github.com/starryds/Denglab.github.io
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
4. Save

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- Detect that you don't have `node_modules` or `dist` folder
- Install Node.js
- Install dependencies (`npm install`)
- Build your site (`npm run build`)
- Deploy to GitHub Pages

Your website will be live at: https://starryds.github.io/Denglab.github.io/
